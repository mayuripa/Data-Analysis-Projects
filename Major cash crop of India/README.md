# Major cash crop of India
Agriculture plays a significant role in the Indian economy, and nearly 60 percent of the population is dependent on agriculture and its allied sectors. It not only provides livelihoods but also fulfils the basic needs of both animals and humans alike. Thus, over 18 percent of the GDP contribution comes from the agriculture sector. Contrary to staple food cultivation, cash crops are mainly produced for commercial purposes and sold in national and international markets.
