# Data Analysis Projects
It always seems hard to know where to start a  Data analytics project. At beginning of the projects, I always faced some questions like What are the goals of the project? How to get familiar with the Data? What are the problems to solve? What can be the possible solution? Which skills are required?  and most important where to begin?

Above you will find a list of Data Analysis projects Implemented in Python, SQL, and PowerBI(My favorite). While implementing any project my main focus has always been on Understanding the Domain and Problem Statement.
Cleaning the messy Data is another interesting process I went through. You will find many visualization graphs like Bar graphs, Line Graphs, Donut Charts, And Many Which Act as Information bride to communicate the Story the data is telling.
